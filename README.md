# Marketing-Data-Analysis
This is an analysis of data curated from a marketing campaign. The project aims to understand the relationship between customer personality and various other factors such as demographics, purchasing habits, and personality traits. 
The study analyzed a dataset that contained information on customer personality by employing various statistical and machine learning techniques such as ANOVA, Chi Squared, Correlation, Clustering, and Classification. The primary goal was to identify patterns, relationships, segments, and classify customers to improve marketing targeting, strategies, and customer experience personalization.
ANOVA was utilized to determine the connection between a categorical variable and a continuous variable. Chi Squared was employed to establish a significant association between two categorical variables. Correlation analysis was performed to detect any relationship between two continuous variables. Clustering, specifically K-means, was employed to cluster similar objects based on the data's characteristics or features and generate customer segments. A prediction model was trained to classify new customers into the generated K-Means segments based on their characteristics and features.
